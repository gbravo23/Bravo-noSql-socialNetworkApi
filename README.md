# Bravo-noSql-socialNetworkApi

This week's challenge is to build an API for a social network using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## User Story

As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
